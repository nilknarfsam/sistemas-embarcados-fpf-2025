 * The first number after the wrap around shall be less than 1024.

 *
 * The SequenceNumber shall be incremented by exactly one for each MessageChunk sent unless
 * the communication channel was interrupted and re-established.
 *
 * Gaps are permitted between the SequenceNumber for the last MessageChunk received before the
 * interruption and the SequenceNumber for first MessageChunk received after communication
 * was re-established.
